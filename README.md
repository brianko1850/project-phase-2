* open a terminal and initiate ``` npm start ```. localhost:3000 should start on default browser.
* open another terminal and initiate ``` json-server --watch ./data/db.json --port 8000 ```.

### Usage

#### Santuary Potties
This is the home page. Here users can search the cities they'd like to look up bathrooms in. Once the application fetches data from "Refuge Restrooms", It will display list of 10 safe restrooms in the city. The Query is not actually limited to the cities but it is recommended in order to return somewhat compartmentalized result.

#### Add a Commode
Once in "Add a commode" tab, Users can fill out name, address and brief directions to the restroom they'd like to add and submit it by clicking "add" button. Submitted restrooms will be posted on "Pending" tab while they are verified.

#### Pending
"Pending" tab will display the bathrooms the users submitted that have not been verified yet.
